# MyReads Project

A React app that serves as a bookshelf to search for books against an API, and saves books in one of 3 categories (currently reading, want to read, read). This app is built from a [starting template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) provided by Udacity.


## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* make sure you have npm on your computer
* download or clone the [repository](https://github.com/tostonar/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* access the app at `localhost:3000`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
